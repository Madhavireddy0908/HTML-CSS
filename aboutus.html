            <h1>Welocome to <span>Our Zoo</span></h1>
            <p>A zoo is a place where wild animals and domesticated animals are exhibited in captivity. In zoos, animals can generally be given more intensive care than is possible in nature reserves or sanctuaries. Most long-established zoos exhibit general collections of animals, but some specialize in particular groups of animals. Zoos are primarily terrestrial facilities where animals are held in enclosures and displayed to the public for education and entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>A zoo (short for zoological garden; also called an animal park or menagerie) is a facility in which animals are kept within enclosures for public exhibition and often bred for conservation purposes.The term zoological garden refers to zoology, the study of animals. The term is derived from the Greek ζώον, zoon, 'animal', and the suffix -λογία, -logia, 'study of'. The abbreviation zoo was first used of the London Zoological Gardens, which was opened for scientific study in 1828, and to the public in 1847.The first modern zoo was the Tierpark Hagenbeck by Carl Hagenbeck in Germany. In the United States alone, zoos are visited by over 181 million people annually.
            </p>
            <p>A zoological garden, zoological park, or zoo is a place where many different species types of animals are kept so that people can see and watch them.Modern zoos try not only to be for people's entertainment, but for education, research, and the conservation and protection of animals. Many zoos are centers where rare animals are preserved when they are in danger of dying out. These modern zoos also want to give the animals a natural life, so that they are healthy and behave normal. This is done for the animals, but also that people can see the animals as if they were in nature, and not in a zoo.
